Drum Sequencer
==============

This is (or will be) a programmable drum machine, using the Web Audio API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm very intrigued by the Web Audio API and, more generally, what web technology has to offer to interactive multimedia.  For over a year, I've wanted to built something of a DAW ("digital audio workstation") for the internet browser. ...Or, even for a standalone platform, like Github's Electron, that utilizes web technology for desktop purposes.  This drum sequencer, in addition to the simple synthesizer I've built, is another effort toward that aforementioned end -the DAW.

It is not complete, unfortunately. When I have the time to work on this project, I end up grueling away at a means to best improve the latency of sample playback.  A DAW is a powerful piece of software, so I want to push myself to make this machine as "high-performance" as possible.

Any suggestions are more than welcome.
